The Distributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of distributions is available for TYPO3, which you can use in
your installation. If in the last step of the installation process in
the Install Tool, you chose that you want to install a distribution,
you will after your first Backend login be redirected to the "Get
preconfigured distribution" screen of the Extension Manager
automatically. (Otherwise you can navigate there manually as well.)

The following distributions are available:


.. _introduction-package:

Introduction Package
""""""""""""""""""""

The introduction package is a complete demo website. It it based on a
responsive design and contains a lot of default content for testing and
learning. Please try this one, if you are new to TYPO3!


.. _government-package:

Government Package
""""""""""""""""""

The government package is another demo website. It is a collection of
best practices to enhance the level of web accessibility. The contents
are rendered in HTML5 based on the famous HTML5Boilerplate. Navigation
and content elements are defined to be accessible for screen readers
and keyboard navigation. HTML5 semantics are used to add more meaning
and structure to the accordant elements. Since web accessibility
guidelines are strict on contrast ratio and readability, an alternative
view to use a different, contrast enhanced stylesheet, has been
integrated as well.


.. _installing-distributions:

Installing Distributions
""""""""""""""""""""""""

For testing and learning we recommend you to use the introduction
package.

If exactly adhering to web standards is especially important for you
(as it e.g. is for government bodies in the EU), you might want to try
the government package.

Just choose the distributions you like and hit "Install".

.. note::
   The installation process of a distribution can take a **long** time. On
   a current laptop I had to wait around 100 minutes for the introduction
   package to finish installing. Do not aboard this process - be patient and
   wait!

For building your own website from scratch, just go ahead *without*
using a distribution. You can then start with a completely empty
installation of TYPO3.
