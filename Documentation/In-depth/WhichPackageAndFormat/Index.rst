Which Package to use
""""""""""""""""""""

There is only one TYPO3 Package called "TYPO3 Source". With this
package you can install TYPO3. It can be used to set up an empty
installation. However, later during installation, you will be asked, if
you want to load additional "Distributions" to kick start with some
out-of-the-box working environment.

An overview of all available packages and versions (also older, but
still supported releases) can be found at
`http://typo3.org/download/ <http://typo3.org/download/>`_.

The TYPO3 Source package is available as a :file:`.zip` or
:file:`.tar.gz` distribution. Their content is the same and you should
download the one that you will be able to extract directly on your
web server.
