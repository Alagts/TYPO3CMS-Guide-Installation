The Install Tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Install Tool is located in 'typo3/install/' and should
automatically start in "1-2-3"-mode with password 'joh316', if you
have not set up any database for the site.

In other words, this is what you should see:

|img-4|  *Click "Continue".*

|img-5|  *Enter your database credentials.*

|img-6|  *Create a new database for TYPO3 or use an existing empty
database.*

|img-7|  *Import the default database tables.*

|img-8|  *The basic installation is now complete.*

After you finished the basic installation procedure, TYPO3 basically
is working. However, there still are options, which have not been
configured yet. We therefore recommend to go to the install tool in
normal mode to change the install tool password and to verify the
details of your configuration. Click the "Configure TYPO3" link to do
so.

You can find more information in the section "In-Depth Installation",
subsection "The Install Tool" below.
